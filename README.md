# Info

SXM Activator PWA

Quick and dirty PWA to activate satellite radios on a trial account. 

Inspired by https://github.com/parker-stephens/siriusxm-activator

# How to use

Go to https://xisonc.github.io/sxm-activator-pwa/ to try it.

This is a fully installable PWA, so feel free to install it on your device.

You can also download and run the app locally using Firefox or Chrome, download the ZIP file, extract the files, and open index.html in your web browser.

# Note

This app funnels requests through a CORS-proxy to allow it to work client side. The app will detect if you need to activate the demo mode of the CORS proxy automatically, just follow the instructions.
